## Work-Life and a balance

Many folks just start an enterprise and in their early stages, they dont differentiate between their personal lives and that of their business. This can lead to a lot of complications later.  Many a time, people are not even sure they want to start a business/enterprise. A large population is employed, though the number of self-employed folks is increasing. We believe that there will be 3 category of workers - employed, self-employed and management. While management is also technically employed, they hold greater responsbility and accountability.



On a side note : We are firm believers in the concept of minimal-wage. All folks are
