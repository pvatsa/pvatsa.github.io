## RubixWorks

RubixWorks is my journey in trying to get software to help my daily workflow rather than hinder it (which I believe many software do!!). More than just a software platform, it is a way of thinking about how software should work - which is why I call it the RubixDNA.

[backstory : the name rubixworks stems from the experience of playing the rubick's cube where the moment we solve one face, we mess up the other. It takes quite a bit of skill to line up all the faces right.

Very similarly, in life an business, when we solve one part of the problem (inventory) with a technical solution, we mess up another (collaboration). Each platform offer a common solution for all business problems or they are a mish-mash of different solutions all cobbled together.

Rubixworks attempts to look at both business and life from different "faces" and tries to offer a comprehensive solution that can result in a 'solved' platform.
