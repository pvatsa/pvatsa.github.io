# Concept 1 - Location from a reference point
[Reference NCERT Book]([https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php?iesc1=8-15](https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php?iesc1=8-15))

All motion is measured from a reference point.
#### A -----(2 meters) ----- B
If a ball moves from point A to point B and we say that it has moved 2 meters, it is now 2 meters from point A - so point A is the reference point for this motion.
#### C----(3 meters) -----A -----(2 meters) ----- B
Instead if we now say that the ball was at A which is 3 meters from point C and it has now moved to B which is 5 meters from point C, then C is the reference point for this motion.
