# Concept 1 - Location from a reference point
[Reference NCERT Book]([https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php?iesc1=8-15](https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php?iesc1=8-15))

All motion is measured from a reference point.

If a ball moves from point A to point B and we say that it has moved 2 meters, it is now 2 meters from point A - so point A is the reference point.
