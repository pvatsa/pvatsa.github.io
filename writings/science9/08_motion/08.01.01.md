# Concept 1 - Location from a reference point
[Reference NCERT Book]([https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php?iesc1=8-15](https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php?iesc1=8-15))

All motion is measured from a reference point.
#### A -----(2 meters) ----- B
If a ball moves from point A to point B and we say that it has moved 2 meters, it is now 2 meters from point A - so point A is the reference point for this motion.
#### C----(3 meters) -----A -----(2 meters) ----- B
Instead if we now say that the ball was at A which is 3 meters from point C and it has now moved to B which is 5 meters from point C, then C is the reference point for this motion.

When a ball is thrown from a balcony and lands on the ground, in most cases, all distances are measured with respect to the ground level as the reference point. Similarly if people climb hills and go down valleys - all heights are measured with the sea level as the reference point.
