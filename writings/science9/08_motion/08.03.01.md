# Concept 3 - Distance and Displacement
[Reference NCERT Book]([https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php?iesc1=8-15](https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php?iesc1=8-15))

Distan

O-------------C---------B-----------A---------->
0-------------25--------35---------60---------->

Consider an object moving from O (reference point) along the line and A,B,C are points along the line that re 60, 35 and 25 meters from O.

There are 2 ways the object can be at points C and B - either when moving **from** O to A or when moving **from** A ***back*** to O

When the object moves from O to A and back to B it has now convered a distance of 60+25 = 85KM
(Note : distance from A to B is 60-35 =25KM)
