# Concept 3 - Distance and Displacement
[Reference NCERT Book]([https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php?iesc1=8-15](https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php?iesc1=8-15))

**Distance** is the length of the path that the object covers when moving. **Displacement** is the shortest distance between the initial and final positions of the object.

O-------------C---------B-----------A---------->
0-------------25--------35---------60---------->

When the object moves from O to A to B, the distance is 60+25=85KM. However the displacement is O to B = 35KM. Similarly, if the object moves from O to A and back to O, the **distance** travelled is 60+60=120KM. However the **displacement** is ZERO as it is now back at O.

**Distance** is a scalar value and is represented 

O-------------C---------B-----------A---------->
-25-----------0---------10---------35---------->
Consider that the object *starts* from C (reference point). When it moves from C to A to O, the **distance** covered is 35+60=95KM. However the **displacement** is -25KM.
