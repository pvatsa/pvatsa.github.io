# Concept 2 - Motion along a straight line
[Reference NCERT Book]([https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php?iesc1=8-15](https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php?iesc1=8-15))

Motion can be in any direction or path. But to make it easier, we mostly consider motion along straight lines.

O-------------C---------B-----------A---------->
0-------------25--------35---------60---------->

Consider an object moving from O (reference point) along the line and A,B,C are points along the line that re 60, 35 and 25 meters from O.

There are 2 ways the object can be at points C and B - either when moving FROM O to A or when moving FR A back to O
