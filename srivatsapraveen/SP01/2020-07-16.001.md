## Getting into a fitness routine

This is a common adage that everyone refers to. But most folks (self included) realize this only when our body starts feeling the pangs of health. A few have put in an early age practive of being healthy - eating right, staying fit, exercising etc. Those who play sports or need to keep fit as part of their careers - coaches, actors, pilots etc - have a structure that ensures they remain as fit as possible. For the rest of us - it is always an after thought.

### Dont be too ambitious
Personally, I have always been lazy and have never been at my fittest best. But as I approach the age of 50(!), my body is sending signs that I need to be more careful about my health. In the past - as my [#GetFit2020](https://twitter.com/srivatsapraveen/status/1243238959875887104) tweet suggests, I have made the mistake of being overly ambitious of my fitness goals (a goal that I obviously did not hit anywhere close to).

Like with anything else, the first target is to get back into a basic fitness routine. Walking and yoga are more than enough to begin with. I do find walking a bit boring, but I need to find a way to make it a regular routine. (TED Talks during walking might help!!). A 15 min yoga routine twice a day should suffice - and even then just focussing on SuryaNamaskar - the complete exercise is good enough for now.

Eating right is one of the key parts of being healthy. I have always had a problem where I drink very less water. This in turn causes innumerable issues and so this is one of the key things that I would want to correct.
