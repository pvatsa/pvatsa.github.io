## Health is wealth

This is a common adage that everyone refers to. But most folks (self included) realize this only when our body starts feeling the pangs of health. A few have put in an early age practive of being healthy - eating right, staying fit, exercising etc. Those who play sports or need to keep fit as part of their careers - coaches, actors, pilots etc - have a structure that ensures they remain as fit as possible. For the rest of us - it is always an after thought.

Personally, I have always been lazy and have never been at my fittest best. But as I approach the age of 50(!), my body is sending signs that I need to be more careful about my health. In the past - as my [#GetFit2020](https://twitter.com/srivatsapraveen/status/1243238959875887104) suggests, I have made the mistake of being overly ambitious of my fitness goals.
