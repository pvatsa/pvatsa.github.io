## Asthrasoft Foundation

The aim of Asthrasoft Foundation is to help us become a better version of ourselves. To do this, we explore what we mean by "better" and undertake projects that can help us move in that direction.

### Projects that we support
 1. [Spirulina Foundation](https://www.spirulinafoundation.com/) - SpirulinaFoundation uses the super food - Spirulina - grown locally to combat malnutrition and boost local employment making a huge difference in the lives of these families.
 
### Ideas that can make a difference
 1. [Evolution of mankind](F01/P000.Cover) - our take on the philosophy of life and what it means to become better human beings.
 2. [Understanding GenX](F02/P000.Cover) - a more practical guide of our experiments in parenting and mentoring.
 3. [Is it time for Digitocracy?](F03/P000.Cover) - Has democracy outlived its usefulness? Is there an alternative that we should start looking at? We think so.
 4. [Wealth vs Value](T04/P000.Cover) - A rethink of the entire monetary system that has become too complex to manage.
 5. [Bits and Bytes](T05/P000.Cover) - Random unorganized thoughts that will hopefully lead to something useful (or at least fun)
