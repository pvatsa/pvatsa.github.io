## Welcome to my journal

This is a journal of thougths that are posted as notes in  markdown. This is the fastest way to pen down thougths and hopefully be better organized.

This repo is organized into 4 broad independent wikis

 1. [Asthrasoft Consulting](asthrasoft.com/README.md) - the wiki of our consulting organization where we talk about technology, business and solutions that bridge the two.
 2. [Rubixworks](rubixworks.com/README.md) - the wiki with notes on our intelligent network.
 2. [Asthrasoft Academy](asthrasoft.net/README.md) - detailed notes on software development and technical tutorials and walkthroughs.
 3. [Asthrasoft Foundation](asthra.net/README.md) - the wiki on creating a social impact and trying to make a better world.
 
under each of the wiki's the notes are organized by categories and topics and each topic is like a mini-ebook with lots of pages and sub-pages inside of it.

[Across all my documentation, I consiously try to use the plural verb - our instead of mine, we instead of me etc. This is because many folks have contributed to  the above enveavours. But sometimes I end up tying me or mine - and that error is solely MINE]our notes on how technology driven companies can gain a strategic edge over others.
