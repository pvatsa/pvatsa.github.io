## Welcome to my journal

This is a journal of thougths that are posted as notes in  markdown. This is the fastest way to pen down thougths and hopefully be better organized.

This repo is organized into 4 broad independent wikis
by categories and topics and each topic is like a mini-ebook with lots of pages and sub-pages inside of it.

 1. [Implementing Innovative Solutions](#solutions) - notes on innovative solution approaches.
 2. [Leveraging Impact Technologies](#technology) - thoughts on technologies that make an impact.
 3. [Creating Business Value](#business) - ideas on business that create value.
 4. 
[Disclaimer : All views here are my own and are just fleeting thoughts in the overall time-space-continuum. If you want to know more, catch up with me over a coffee]
[Across all my documentation, I consiously try to use the plural verb - our instead of mine, we instead of me etc. This is because many folks have contributed to  the above enveavours. But sometimes I end up tying me or mine - and that error is solely MINE]our notes on how technology driven companies can gain a strategic edge over others.
