## Welcome to my journal

This is a journal of all my thougths and postings as a markdown. This is the fastest way for me to pen down all my thougths and hopefully be better organized.

This repo is organized by categories and topics and each topic is like a mini-ebook with lots of pages and sub-pages inside of it.

[I currently use StackEdit.io for all my markdown needs. I already feel that I will outgrow StackEdit in the future, but for now, this is the best editor that lets me get on with my work]
