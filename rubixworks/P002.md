## The Rubixworks  platform

The Rubixworks platform needs to put a lot of infrastructure in place before it can leverage the value of the network. One of the first and foremost challenge is that of identity.

### RubixIDs and Profiles.
On many platforms people can create multiple IDs. People can have multiple gmail IDs, multiple facebook/twitter accounts, muliple websites, multiple names (maiden names vs married names) and so on. But a strong network automatically validates the identity of the user. On Rubixworks, we call these as profiles. Users can create any number of profiles (think of them as aliases) that can be used on any network. However, properties of the profile can remain un-verified till a network verifies the same.

### Rubix Networks
Rubixworks allows everyone to create an account and use it with both their personal and offical networks. This makes their life easier as they can track their family schedules and their work calendars and take a balanced decision on planning their life. 

### Rubix Pods
Rubixworks offers a host of pods for personal and professional use. These include
 1. Rubix Social - where you can connect and interact with friends and contacts
 2. Rubix Planner - where you can organize your tasks and schedules
 3. Rubix Money - where you can plan your personal finances and track your bills and payments.
 4. Rubix Education - where you can interact with your kids schools and other classes (sports, music, tutions etc)
 5. Rubix Academy - where you can learn online from a variety of courses.
 1. Rubix Marketing - where you can manage your out reach and lead generation
 2. Rubix Sales - where you track leads that convert into deals and track recievables.
 3. Rubix Purchases - where you can manage vendors and track orders and payables.
 4. Rubix Payroll - wher you can track and manage salaries and adjustments for employees
 5. Rubix Accounting - where you can manage your books and taxes

and so on. The concept of networks allows a person to start with a personal network, but also participate in multiple networks like their "corporate" network, a club or other networks that they are part of.
[Keep in mind that a pod can be used either in a personal network or a professional one
