## The Rubixworks platform

Anytime we set out to build a platform, we need a lot of plumbing before we get to the interesting parts. Tech savvy founders can spend years just putting together the foundation. Business focussed founders would like to skip this part and get onto delivering features. In reality a balance between the 2 approaches helps a strong foundation and also deliver fetures faster to the market.

### The development approach.
This is the approach that I advocate to teams. For simplicity - assume that we will give out a feature rich release every quarter. Within this, assume that you will do a weekly release to production. In order to do this, plan for a daily rolling release to testing --> to beta customers --> to all customers.

Now, think that whatever you wanted to deliver this quarter, is DONE. Now see from the eyes of your customer - what is the first thing that they would do to use your platform. THAT is the first thing you have to enable. All the background features/modules required for that will also need to be put in place. This makes the process of prioritization easier. Now lets follow the same approach for Rubixworks.

### Rubixworks - M1
The first thing that we want users to do on Rubixworks includes the following
 - Visit the Rubixworks site and get some useful information (that makes them interested registering with Rubixworks).
 - Register and login to Rubixworks and manage their profile and preferences.
 - Get some useful features for free that makes the users come back to rubixworks frequently.

So lets break this down some more. What features/content on the rubixworks site will be useful? What features/content inside the portal will be useful? 

One of the things that everyone is facing is an overload of information. News sites, blogs, youtube, whatsapp, instagram, sms(!), iMessage, emails - we have a barrage of information that we need to keep organized. So the first thing that we would want users on Rubixworks to manage is different types of information from a common lobby. The lobby can have the following things to catch up on
 - News from around the world that they want to know of.
 - Posts from blogs that the user subscribe to.
 - Videos from channels that they would like to follow
 - Updates from notes on topics that they find useful.
 
In the theme of Rubixworks, a common dashboard where an AI curated list from all these will make it really useful for the user so that they dont waste their time across all the different sources of news.

With this in mind, it also makes sense to keep similar information public on the Rubixworks site - except that - the site information is limited to all the news about productivity for startups and rubixworks features.

### Rubixworks - M2
