## Welcome to the RubixWorks Wiki

Rubixworks is an "Intelligent Network" that was incubated at Asthrasoft Consulting. Still in early beta, this repo will contain notes about it as it evolves.

RubixWorks is a journey in trying to get software to help people's daily workflow rather than hinder it (which many software do!!). More than just a software platform, it is a way of thinking about how intelligent software should be designed.

[backstory : the name rubixworks stems from the experience of playing the rubick's cube where the moment we solve one face, we mess up the other. It takes quite a bit of skill to line up all the faces right.

Very similarly, in life and in business, when we solve one part of the problem (inventory, scheduling, accounting), we mess up another (collaboration, social, project management). Many businesses put together a mish-mash of different solutions all cobbled together working in-efficiently.

Rubixworks attempts to look intelligently at both business and life from different "faces" and tries to offer a comprehensive solution that can result in a 'solved' platform.
